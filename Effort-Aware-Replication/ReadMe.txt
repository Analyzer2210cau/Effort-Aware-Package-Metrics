Effort-Aware Classification: This folder contains data-sets and R-scripts for experimental analysis of effort aware classification models.    
Effort-Aware Ranking: This folder contains data-sets and R-scripts for generating graphical model of effort-aware ranking.  

working directory is "script_r" folder. This "script_r" folder consists of R scripts and README.txt that explains how to run R scripts.

[HowToRun in Windows Environment]

> copy the path of particular data-sets 
> Run R scripts related to effort aware-classification to find results of ER-BPP and ER-MFM metrics  
> Run R scripts related to effort aware-ranking to obtain graphs having curves of random, ideal, T and T+H.Abdeen Model 


[Output]
> Classification results are depicted in Table 6 
> Ranking results shown in Figure 3
